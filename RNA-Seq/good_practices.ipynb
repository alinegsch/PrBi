    "> (generally the older ways are still supported in the newer Python minor\n",
    "> releases).\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare the type of a version, you can do:\n",

    "## Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "One particular aspect of coding style covers the feature of Python that allows modules, functions, classes and methods to be described by a simple triple-quoted string, the documentation string, or more commonly referred to as just \"docstring\". Whenever docstrings are used they have to represent the first statement (i.e., non-comment and non-blank line) of the code unit they describe. For example, for a function a docstring would be placed right after the function definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    \"\"\"I am a docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings are important because they can be used to automatically generate extensive documentation for a Python package/module/class/function, and it ties the documentation directly to the code, which helps tremendously in ensuring that code and documentation do not diverge over time. In fact, docstrings are deemed important enough that they received their own PEP, [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), which goes way beyond what [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) has to say about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We _strongly_ recommend you to write extensive docstrings at least for those of your modules, classes and functions that might ever be useful on their own to other people, including your future self! It may be tedious to write them, but in the end it will increase the uptake of your code, trust in your code and a better reputation as a developer. Writing the documentation also makes you think again about your code and possible side effects or edge cases of your functions, methods and classes.\n",

The most popular one for Python is [Black](https://github.com/psf/black). While code formatters can be very helpful, we do not recommend them for beginners, as it is better to put work in developing good habits rather than relying on software. Also, they come with the downside that it is difficult to automate the inclusion of a code formatter, because they cannot be easily integrated into a CI pipeline, given that they actually _change_ the code (something that shouldn't normally happen inside during CI).  \n",

We strongly recommend you to set this up for yourself, as it is a huge time saver and, given that you get immediate feedback if you go wrong, you will learn sticking to a clean coding style much better."

    "#### Monkeypatching\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, in _unit tests_ we are testing blocks of code in isolation. But what if our code depends on the functionality of third-party code? Should our tests extend to documented (and hopefully tested) behavior of other people's code? For unit tests, the answer is \"It depends!\". While we should never go as far as writing entire unit tests for other people's code, if our code depends on it, we should usually try to cover with our tests all responses (return values or errors) we may reasonably expect from it. However, we should also make sure that our tests run quickly and ideally do not depend on too many dependencies, e.g., the availability of an external service or database. So what can we do to avoid it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is _**monkeypatching**_ or _**mocking**_, the practice of overriding code to return a specifc, well-defined response.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several uses cases for monkeypatching (see [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/monkeypatch.html) for some more), but let's focus on the example mentioned earlier, the dependency of an external service that we are trying to call via HTTP. Consider this example code (adapted from [`pytest`'s documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/monkeypatch.html#monkeypatching-returned-objects-building-mock-classes)):\n",

    "So what if the URL is done when we are running our tests? The tests would likely fail and we might scratch our heads, thinking that something is wrong with our own code, when in fact it was just a server outage. Of course, you should _also_ include in your code the possibility that such outages exist and test for _that_ behavior, but you will also need to test the expected _normal_ behavior, so in comes _monkeypatching_:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, we set our test up in a way that it isn't actually making that call to the `url` anymore, but rather we simply get the response that we put in. For the simple code block we have tested, this may seem somewhat pointless, because there's basically _nothing else_ but that call to the URL and so why bother testing it if we basically then don't actually make that call and just tell it what to return us instead. We're just getting out what we put in - way to test! But now imagine that there's more in `get_json()`, some processing that actually needs proper testing? In that case, we would be able to test that code independently of the availability of a server at URL `url` or in the absence of an internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from setting/overriding and deleting class attributes, the `monkeytest` fixture also has methods to set and delete dictionary items and environment variables. And while it is difficult for beginners to estimate when to use monkeypatching in practice and we will probably not need to make use of it for our coding project, we feel it is important for you to know that overriding external code, data and variables is _possible_ should the need ever arise (and it soon will if you start doing something more complex!)."

    "### Best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mind what you commit**  \n",
    "   Only commit manually generated files. Auto-generated files can be recreated\n",
    "   later and only clutter the repository. For the same reason (and also because\n",
    "   Git servers impose restrictions on total file and/or repository sizes), do\n",
    "   not commit big files, such as data files, so keep your test files small and\n",
    "   relevant. Do not commit any artefacts that are specific to your environment,\n",
    "   e.g., absolute file paths (this is also a potential security issue!) and,\n",
    "   most importantly, **do not commit secrets or any other sensitive\n",
    "   information!** There are bots out there that are constantly scanning public\n",
    "   Git repositories for such information, and it is cumbersome to rewrite\n",
    "   the Git history to completely remove such information. String patterns\n",
    "   matching file and directory names to be included can be indicated in various\n",
    "   places, most often in a version-controlled `.gitignore` file that is placed\n",
    "   in the repository root directory. However, patterns for files that you want\n",
    "   to exclude for all repositories and that are specific to your work\n",
    "   environment (e.g., editor-specific artefacts such as lock and backup files),\n",
    "   you should rather indicate globally. Have a look at the [\"gitignore\"\n",
    "   documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) to find out how to use\n",
    "   it. We also recommend that you make use of the\n",
    "   [gitignore.io](http://gitignore.io/) service that auto-generates \"gitignore\"\n",
    "   patterns for you based from a wide list of keywords (e.g., `Python`,\n",
    "   `VisualStudioCode`, `Linux`). Given the importance of configuring Git to\n",
    "   ignore certain files, we have included the generation of a `.gitignore` file\n",
    "   in the homework below.\n",
    "2. **Create single-purpose commits with semantic commit messages**  \n",
    "   Analogous to the [single-responsibility\n",
    "   principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)\n",
    "   of software development, a commit should wrap only functionally and/or\n",
    "   semantically related changes. For example, if you find a typo in your\n",
    "   project's documentation while you are working on something else, do not\n",
    "   just fix it along with your other changes. It's easier to review code that\n",
    "   is consisting of the least possible number of lines. It's also easier to\n",
    "   roll back buggy code without any additional side effects. Finally, it will\n",
    "   make for a clean commit history and changelog, so that users of your\n",
    "   software can track its development and the release of new features and bug\n",
    "   fixes. In this regard, we strongly recommended that you describe your\n",
    "   commits using concise (up to 50 characters in the title line) semantic\n",
    "   commit messages following the\n",
    "   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)\n",
    "   specification. It may be painful at first, but learning it early should\n",
    "   prevent you from adopting bad practices, and it comes with multiple\n",
    "   benefits, including a clean and consistent commit history, the ability to\n",
    "   create changelogs, bump versions according to the widely used [Semantic\n",
    "   Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) specification and even publish\n",
    "   entire releases automatically (in Python, e.g., with the\n",
    "   [`python-semantic-release`](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "   package).\n",
    "3. **Do not rewrite history**  \n",
    "   Once you push code to a public repository, others are able to pull the code\n",
    "   and work on it (which you may not necessarily be aware of). If you change\n",
    "   the commit graph between the time point that someone has checked out the old\n",
    "   history tree and the time point they are trying to merge their new code, Git\n",
    "   will not be able to resolve the resulting conflicts, causing much justified\n",
    "   frustration. Apart from creating irresolvable conflicts, rewriting history\n",
    "   can also lead to contributions being misattributed to different people\n",
    "   (imagine someone rewriting your paper, stripping your name and replacing the\n",
    "   old version with the new one on the publisher's website) and difficulties in\n",
    "   tracking the progress of your project. Of course, as with (almost) every\n",
    "   guidelines, there are valid exceptions: For example, in some Git workflows,\n",
    "   including the one we are using, the history of a _feature branch_ (but not\n",
    "   a release/stable branch) can be rewritten in order to clean up or squash\n",
    "   commits before merging. Here, by convention, the assumption generally holds\n",
    "   that only a single person is working on a iven feature branch agt a time.\n",
    "   Another exception is when you inadvertently commit sensitive information to\n",
    "   your repository (see above). Clearly, in such a situation even rewriting a\n",
    "   stable branch may become necessary.\n",
