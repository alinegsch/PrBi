**Exercises from programming in bioinformatics lecture about RNA-Sequencing.**

It's my first time programming with Python and first own project - tried my best to solve the exercises.

Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to handle the path that it works on any computer - directories need to be changed to run the programm.

This project has
- a directory **/RNA-Seq** that contains the three exercise sheets and information from lectures, a subdirectory **/RNA-Seq/Test files** that contains given example files which are used in the exercises
- a directory **/src** that contains *parse_fasta.py* from excercise sheet 1 - prints frequency from dna-letters from input fasta files, *sam_to_fasta_file.py* from exercise sheet 2 - coverts sam to fasta file, *main.py* that runs the tasks and its created files
- a directory **/tests** that prooves the written functions
- *run_me.sh* another way to run the tasks (from bash)
- *LICENSE* and *environment.yml* that were asked in exercise sheet 3
